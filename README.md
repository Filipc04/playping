# PlayPing
PlayPing, an app where you can set up gaming sessions with your friends.

I got tired of always having to type and remember all of the different times my friends were available and not available to play video games. So instead, I created playping to fix this problem. It works by running in the background, and if you go into your windows tray on the bottom right, you can open the program, create a gaming session (set the time, what game, etc) and then your friends (where playping is also running in the background) will get a Windows Notification to go into PlayPing and tick if they are available to play or not. In the future, it would be cool to add a friend system where you can see eachother statuses to see if they are for example: Wanting to play, willing to play if more people are, busy, etc.

The program is being developed as an Electron app, and I am using React along with ofcourse HTML, CSS and also JavaScript. For keeping track of the different sessions and responses I used a Firebase Database.
